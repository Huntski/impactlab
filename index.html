                    There are many issues we as a company want people to be aware of. We as humans have a responsibility to look after the world we live on. But no one can do it alone. We need everyone to work together and understand what problems we  face in the world.

                    So let’s do that together. Learn and spread the word.

                    <p>
                        Since the temperatures are getting higher and higher, forest fires have been becoming a bigger and more perpetual problem. This is why we need to make plans to try and minimize the damage that can be done from a forest fire until we find a way to get the temperatures down.

                        We need to protect our forests!

                    <h3>Plastic soup</h3>
                    <p>
                        There is a huge amount of plastic in the seas. This is a huge problem for all the animals that live in these waters, and if it’s a problem for them it’s a problem for us. This is because now in almost all the water and seafood we eat and drink there is some amount of plastic. Research has found that an average adult consumes about 35,000 microplastics a year. If we don’t start fixing this problem it will start getting worse.

                        Will you help to carry plastic out of the ocean?

                        The poles are melting and this is a huge problem since all this water will immensely rise the water level. Next to this it’s destroying many lives of multiple kinds of animals. WE can’t let them be the victim of something we are doing.
